# SmartCivic
SmartCivic is a utility management application built with the MERN stack, designed to facilitate efficient complaint handling within a building. The system enables users to submit complaints, allows admins to manage and assign tasks, and provides workers with tools to resolve issues in a streamlined way.

•	Role-Based Access Control: Three user roles—User, Admin, and Worker—each with specific access and capabilities.
•	Complaint Assignment and Tracking: Admins can assign complaints to workers, track progress, and update statuses.
•	File Uploads: Users can attach images to complaints for clarity.
•	Secure Authentication: JWT-based login with role-based access control for secure data handling.
•	Responsive Design: Optimized interface for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Tech Stack
•	Frontend: React, TailwindCSS
•	Backend: Node.js, Express
•	Database: MongoDB
•	File Handling: Multer for image uploads
•	Authentication: JWT-based email and password signup/login with role selection
